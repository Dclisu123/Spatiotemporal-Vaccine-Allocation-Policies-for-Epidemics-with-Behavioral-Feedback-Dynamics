# Spatiotemporal Vaccine Allocation Policies for Epidemics with Behavioral Feedback Dynamics

This is the README file for the Spatiotemporal Vaccine Allocation Policies for Epidemics with Behavioral Feedback Dynamics project.

## Description

This project focuses on the allocation of vaccines from a limited stockpile to different jurisdictions over time, with a particular emphasis on the COVID-19 pandemic. The project proposes an epidemiological model that incorporates a stylized behavioral feedback mechanism to reflect the multi-wave transmission dynamics of the disease. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of various information-sensitive allocation policies as alternatives to the widely used pro-rata policy.

In addition, the project develops optimized vaccine allocation strategies that take into account fairness and implementable freeze-period constraints under the proposed epidemiological model. The results show that, for a multi-wave epidemic as represented by the compartmental model with behavioral feedback, none of the alternative policies offer consistently more efficient allocations than a simple pro-rata policy across a broad range of behavioral parameter settings. In fact, in some cases, the alternative policies may actually result in less efficient allocations than the pro-rata policy.

However, the project's findings also indicate that the identified optimized strategies are a more favorable option for policy makers who are willing to invest in more tailored strategies based on numerical optimization. These optimized strategies allow for a more efficient allocation of vaccines while taking into account fairness and implementable freeze-period constraints.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine:
