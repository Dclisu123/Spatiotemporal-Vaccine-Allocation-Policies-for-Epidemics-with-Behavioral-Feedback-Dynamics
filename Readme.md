# Spatiotemporal Vaccine Allocation Policies for Epidemics with Behavioral Feedback Dynamics

This is the README file for the Spatiotemporal Vaccine Allocation Policies for Epidemics with Behavioral Feedback Dynamics project.

## Description

This project presents a spatiotemporal optimization framework to allocate vaccines during an epidemic outbreak that incorporates human behavioral feedback dynamics. The framework integrates the effects of both human behavior and spatial heterogeneity of epidemic outbreak, to develop spatiotemporal vaccine allocation policies. The policies aim to optimize the distribution of limited vaccine supplies in a way that maximizes the number of individuals vaccinated while minimizing the spread of the disease. The project is implemented in Python 3, and it uses the following packages: `GEKKO`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine:

```

git clone https://github.com/username/Spatiotemporal-Vaccine-Allocation-Policies-for-Epidemics-with-Behavioral-Feedback-Dynamics.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you will need to install the required packages:

```

pip install GEKKO matplotlib pandas numpy
```

## Usage

To use the project, you can run the following command:

```

python main.py
```

This will run the main script and perform the spatiotemporal optimization to allocate vaccines during an epidemic outbreak. You can also customize the behavior of the optimization by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file.
